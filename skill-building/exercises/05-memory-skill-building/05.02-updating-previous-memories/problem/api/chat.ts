        PERMANENT MEMORIES are facts about the user that:
        - Are unlikely to change over time (preferences, traits, characteristics)
        - Will remain relevant for weeks, months, or years
        - Include personal details, preferences, habits, or important information shared
        - Are NOT temporary or situational information

        EXAMPLES OF PERMANENT MEMORIES:
        - "User prefers dark mode interfaces"
        - "User works as a software engineer"
        - "User has a dog named Max"
        - "User is learning TypeScript"
        - "User prefers concise explanations"
        - "User lives in San Francisco"

        EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO MEMORIZE:
        - "User asked about weather today" (temporary)
        - "User is currently debugging code" (situational)
        - "User said hello" (trivial interaction)

        Extract any new permanent memories from this conversation. Return an array of memory strings that should be added to the user's permanent memory. Each memory should be a concise, factual statement about the user.
